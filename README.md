# MyKdramaList

This is an simply for keeping track of my korean shows and movies.

Track which drama's I've watched and which I haven't.
Track drama's I'm currently watching.
Track my rating for drama's I've watched.


Will be using webscrapper's I've found on github for app data

homepage sections:m Top Airing Shows, Top Upcoming Shows, Most Popular Shows, Trending This Week, Shows Starting This Week, Shows Ending This Week

My scapper will extract data from the homepage and will be used to populate the database. I'll then feed the data from my database to kuryana's api to let it handle the work


I might host a database over healersoft to store the data from the scrapes then create a rest api over there to feed data to this app
